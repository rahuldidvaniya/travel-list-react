# Travel Packing List Manager

This is a simple React app to help you manage your travel packing list. You can add items, mark them as packed, and delete them when not needed. The app includes a form to add items, a list to view and manage them, and a stats section to see how many items are packed. Just clone the repo, run `npm install`, and start with `npm start` to get going!
